data_generator.py (dg) is intended to enable teachers, hobbyists, students, etc to create defined data sets for use in classrooms, self study and as data for puzzles. This allows an instructor to create a well defined data set with known characteristics.

The general premise is that dg produces tabular data based on certain seeds. The tables can be output into file formats such as csv or sql. The current seeds are simply a list of superhero names from the DC Comics pantheon.

Required input file format:
Line 1: a representative domain name (such as jleague.org)
Lines 2 to the end: sample user names (such as bruce wayne)

Supported output file formats:
* csv
* sql
